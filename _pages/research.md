My research is broadly focused on AI for climate and Earth science. I've developed deep learning methods that drastically accelerate climate model predictions while quantifying critical uncertainties—bridging the gap between complex Earth systems and actionable insights. While some of my work involves emulation of ice sheet dynamics, the underlying goals are much broader: creating scalable, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware tools for climate modeling and environmental applications.

I've published first-author work in journals like JAMES, GMD, and TMLR, and have coauthored interdisciplinary papers including a high-impact Nature review on AI-driven scientific discovery. I maintain open-source packages like ise, which provide reproducible pipelines for building ML models in geosciences. My work is supported by the NSF GRFP and has been presented at AGU, the International Liège Colloquium, and other major venues.
