I'm Peter, a Ph.D. Candidate at Brown University in Providence Rhode Island. I am in the [Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS)](https://deeps.brown.edu/) and the [Data Science Institude at Brown (DSI)](https://dsi.brown.edu/) with an affiliation with the [Institute at Brown University for Environment and Society (IBES)](https://ibes.brown.edu/). I work with [Dr. Karianne J. Bergen](https://www.kariannebergen.com/) in the [SciML Research Group](https://sites.brown.edu/bergen-lab/).

My work sits at the intersection of scientific machine learning, climate science, and data science. I build AI systems that enable faster, more interpretable, and more reliable modeling of Earth processes—tools that help researchers and decision-makers confront climate risks with greater confidence and clarity. From deep learning frameworks for sea level rise projections to reinforcement learning for autonomous air traffic control, my projects span academia, government, and industry.
